## Introduction

This project demonstrates how to build a Transformer model from scratch using PyTorch for the task of translating English sentences into Italian. The Transformer architecture, introduced by Vaswani et al. in "Attention Is All You Need," has revolutionized natural language processing by allowing parallelization and better handling of long-range dependencies.

## Features

- 🤖 **Custom Implementation**: Transformer model built from scratch.
- 🌎 **Language Translation**: English to Italian translation.
- ⏳ **Efficient Training**: Includes techniques to optimize training such as learning rate scheduling and gradient clipping.
- 🌄 **Modern NLP Techniques**: Implements self-attention, positional encoding, and beam search for decoding.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training is a collection of English-Italian sentence pairs. Ensure your dataset is properly preprocessed and formatted with the following fields:

- **Source Language (English)**: Contains English sentences.
- **Target Language (Italian)**: Corresponding Italian translations.

## Model Architecture

Our Transformer model includes:

- **Encoder**: Processes the source sentence.
- **Decoder**: Generates the target sentence.
- **Multi-head Self-Attention**: Allows the model to focus on different parts of the sentence.
- **Feed-Forward Neural Networks**: Enhances the representational capacity of the model.
- **Positional Encoding**: Adds information about the position of words in the sequence.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/transformer-translation.git
   cd transformer-translation
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Training

To train the model, run:
```bash
python train.py --data_path path/to/dataset --epochs 20 --batch_size 32
```

### Inference

Translate English sentences to Italian:
```bash
python translate.py --model_path path/to/saved/model --input_sentence "Hello, how are you?"
```

## Results

Demonstrating its capability to effectively translate English sentences to Italian.

## Future Work

- 🌍 **Support for Additional Languages**: Extend the model to handle more language pairs.
- 🧶 **Pretrained Models**: Incorporate pretraining on larger datasets.
- 📊 **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Further tune the hyperparameters for better performance.
